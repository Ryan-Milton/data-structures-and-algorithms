# FizzBuzzTree
Sara and I were partnered for this Code Challenge

## Challenge
 Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes respectively. Return the tree with itâ€™s news values.

## Approach and Efficiency
We approached this problem by assuming we were using the Binary Tree class we created last week and all the methods along with it. We essentially descructured the preOrder method and created a helper function that calls itself to traverse and change the values if they fall under the parameters that are set above.

## Big O
Time = O(n)
Space = O(h)
