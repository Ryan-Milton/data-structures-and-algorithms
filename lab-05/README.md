# Linked List Iterations
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node. Add three methods.

## Challenge

The linked list constructor should have methods which will append `.append(value)` a new node to the end of the list, insert a new node before another node `.insertBefore(value, newNodeValue)`, and insert a new node after another node `.insertAfter(value, newNodeValue)`.
